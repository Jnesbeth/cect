### Title: failure_rate abnormally high

### Reproducible Steps:
1. In the configuration set at least one of the failure_rate for senders to 0.5. Eg: 
```
num_messages: 1000
report_period: 2.0
senders:
  - mean_time: 0.01
    failure_rate: 0.50
```
2. Run the application: cargo run -- cect.yml

### Observations:
1. The failed messages at the time of the log from Monitor seems to report incorrectly with the failure_rate set to 0.50 (%50) it seems to fail consistently at over %90 or over the reported messages sent:
```
1 run: [2023-03-05T17:36:58Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 1000, failed: 944, rate: 32.519/s
2 run: [2023-03-05T17:39:47Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 1000, failed: 1062, rate: 31.102/s
```
2. Bug report 2 might be related to 3

### Expected Results:
1. The failure rate lines up with the configured variables set, where the monitoring report should report:
send: 1000, failed: ~500
