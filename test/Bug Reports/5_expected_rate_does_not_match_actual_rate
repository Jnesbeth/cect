### Title: The expected rate does not match the actual rate

### Reproducible Steps:
1. In the configuration set at least one of the mean_time for senders to 0.001 Eg:
```
num_messages: 1000
report_period: 2.0
senders:
  - mean_time: 0.001
    failure_rate: 0.00
```
2. Run the application: cargo run -- cect.yml

### Observations:
1. The following is being reported:
```
[2023-03-05T22:39:38Z INFO  cect] Expected rate 1000.000/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:38Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 0, failed: 0, rate: N/A
[2023-03-05T22:39:40Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 130, failed: 0, rate: 64.536/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:42Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 261, failed: 0, rate: 64.905/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:44Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 391, failed: 0, rate: 64.871/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:46Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 523, failed: 0, rate: 65.099/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:48Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 653, failed: 0, rate: 65.042/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:50Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 783, failed: 0, rate: 65.015/s
[2023-03-05T22:39:52Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 914, failed: 0, rate: 65.055/s
```
2. Seems as if the expected rate is calculated using the mean_time in some form to get that expected rate, however it does not seem to match the actual rate reported from the monitor logs 

### Expected Results:
1. The expected rate is close to or matches the actual rate.
