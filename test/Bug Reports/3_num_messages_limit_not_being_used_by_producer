### Title: num_messages limit not being used by producer

### Reproducible Steps:
1. In the configuration set at least one of the failure_rate for senders to 1.0
```
num_messages: 1000
report_period: 2.0
senders:
  - mean_time: 0.01
    failure_rate: 1.00
```
2. Run the application: cargo run -- cect.yml

### Observations:
1. Setting failure_rate to 1.0 (%100) the simulation seems to not stop without manual intervention:
```
[2023-03-05T17:51:47Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 0, failed: 12400, rate: N/A
[2023-03-05T17:51:48Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 0, failed: 12466, rate: N/A
[2023-03-05T17:51:49Z INFO  cect::monitor] MONITOR sent: 0, failed: 12530, rate: N/A
error: process didn't exit successfully: `target\debug\cect.exe cect.yml` (exit code: 0xc000013a, STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT)
```
2. This might be a misunderstanding of what the failure_rate means and the num_messages are based on the successful messages after the fact. If there are no successful messages then the script will keep going until it hits the num_messages limit. However, from the README: A single producer task sends `num_messages` random messages into a message channel. Which seems to mean that the producer should have stopped after sending the configured num_messages

### Expected Results:
1. The simulation stops at the configured num_messages limit
